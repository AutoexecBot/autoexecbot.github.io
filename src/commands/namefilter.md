# Name Filter

Name filtering is used to ban chatters and new followers with offensive names that may not match your community guidelines for your channel.  It is an optional feature and you are not required to use it in your channel.  It provides the ability to add and remove name filters and allows for users to be whitelisted, if their name is caught by an over-eager filter.  The filters use a custom [filter syntax](./filtersyntax.md) designed for AutoexecBot to allow for flexible matching against phrases.

All of the commands listed on this page are restricted to usage by the channel broadcaster and moderators only.

> âš  There's currently no way to list all of the existing filters.  This is a feature that will be added in the future once the website is available.

## Subcommands
