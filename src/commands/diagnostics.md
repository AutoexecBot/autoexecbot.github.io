# Diagnostics

From time to time, when asking for support for your copy of AutoexecBot you may be asked to provide some diagnostic information.  This section covers the commands that can be used by bot admins, channel broadcasters, and moderators to obtain that information.

## Runtime

> **Usage**
>
> `!runtime`

The bot will report how long it has been running for.  This is useful for helping to know when the bot was last restarted, to look for any potential crash events.

## Version

> **Usage**
>
> `!version` 

The bot will report its current version.  This is useful for reporting which version of the bot is running in your channel when asking for support.
